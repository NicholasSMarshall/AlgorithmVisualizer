          Sorting is something we do every day without even thinking about 
          it — organizing books by height, arranging files by name, or stacking 
          cards in order. On this site, you'll explore how computers do the same 
          thing, using powerful and efficient sorting algorithms. Whether you're 
          a beginner or brushing up on fundamentals, this site will help you 
          understand the logic, visualize how sorting works, and see how it 
          connects to real life.

                Sorting algorithms mirror the way we naturally organize the world around us. 
                As you explore these algorithms, you'll notice patterns that feel familiar—like 
                arranging items by size, alphabetizing a list, or sorting cards in your hand. 
                These techniques aren't just abstract computer logic; they reflect the intuitive 
                strategies we use every day to bring order to chaos.
